# Titanic Analysis and Modelling

This project is to be a good muckaround with data preparation techniques and practical data science skills like github.  

Repository structure (at this time) is as follows:  
```
|--src  
|     |--analyis.R  
|     |--titanic.Rproj  
|  
|--data  
|     |--gender_submission.csv  
|     |--test.csv  
|     |--train.csv  
|  
|--test  
```
> Note that it is in so many ways a terrible idea to commit your data files. I'm just too lazy to commit properly.  

This will potentially change in the future as I aim to familiarise myself with good project hygiene and CI/CD processes through the use of Jenkins.
