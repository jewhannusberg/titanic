# Titanic Analysis and Modelling

This project is to be a good muckaround with data preparation techniques and practical data science skills like github. 

Repository structure (at this time) is as follows:

|-src
|   |--analyis.R
|   |--titanic.Rproj
|
|-data
|   |--gender_submission.csv
|   |--test.csv
|   |--train.csv
|
|-test

This will potentially change in the future as I aim to familiarise myself with good project hygiene and CI/CD processes through the use of Jenkins.
